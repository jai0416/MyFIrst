Git push origin master is a special command-line utility that specifies the remote branch and directory. When you have multiple branches and directory, then this command assists you in determining your main branch and repository.

Moreover, we can say the push updates the remote refs with local refs. Every time you push into the repository, it is updated with some interesting changes that you made. If we do not specify the location of a repository, then it will push to default location at origin master.
